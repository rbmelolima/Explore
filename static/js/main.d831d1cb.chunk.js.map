This big blowout is believed to be due to the black hole eating too much and experiencing a transient bout of \\\"black hole nausea\\\", which resulted in the ejection of a powerful radio jet blasting into intergalactic space.  The amount of energy needed to blow this cavity is equivalent to about 10 billion supernova explosions.\",\r\n      \"hdurl\": \"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/OphGalaxyClusterLabeled_Chandra_960.jpg\",\r\n      \"media_type\": \"image\",\r\n      \"service_version\": \"v1\",\r\n      \"title\": \"An Extreme Black Hole Outburst\",\r\n      \"url\": \"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/OphGalaxyClusterLabeled_Chandra_960.jpg\"\r\n    },\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nexport default backupPhotos","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\r\nimport axios from 'axios'\r\nimport './style.css'\r\n\r\nimport Grid from '../../components/Grid'\r\nimport Photo from '../../components/Photo'\r\nimport key from '../../key'\r\nimport apod from '../../protocols/apod'\r\nimport Loading from '../../components/Loading'\r\n\r\nimport backupPhotos from '../../backup/index'\r\n\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState<apod[]>([])\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    getPhotos()\r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n  async function getPhotos() {\r\n    const photosSession = sessionStorage.getItem('photos')\r\n\r\n    if (photosSession === null) {\r\n      try {\r\n        const response = await axios.get<apod[]>(`https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=${key}&count=35&hd=true`)\r\n        if (response.status === 200) {\r\n          const filtered = response.data.filter(photo => photo.media_type === \"image\")\r\n          const jsonPhotos = JSON.stringify(filtered)\r\n          setPhotos(filtered)\r\n          sessionStorage.setItem('photos', jsonPhotos)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n      } catch (error) {\r\n        setPhotos(backupPhotos)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    else {\r\n      const parse = JSON.parse(photosSession)\r\n      setPhotos(parse)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async function getMorePhotos() {\r\n    const clean = () => sessionStorage.clear()\r\n    clean()\r\n    getPhotos()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (photos.length === 0) {\r\n    return <Loading />\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <main>\r\n      <div className=\"content\">\r\n        <header>\r\n          <h1>Explore</h1>\r\n          <p>Discover the cosmos!
